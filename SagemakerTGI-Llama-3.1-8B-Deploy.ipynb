If you\\'re not sure where to start, I can guide you through the process.\\n\\nI am created a VOBEUS ROUTE submission for a Oracle flight scheduling application. I submitted the sequence of legs via JMS (Java Message Service) and obtaining a service request id in response. Then I renamed property called AB FLT919 to Parent Dep Id and obtained the child ports  Sched Departure Time and Changed  on updated flight \\nI then called Flight Schedule retrieve to get these information as json object. Attempt to access the function definition of FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn. to Profile compressed json object however FOBJECT throw an exception when paradigm quality “Negative” since speed profile FOBJECTthis is not possible. Therefore I asked for further clarification, and here is how it should be implemented\\xa0   \\xa0 First, “Staff should not see user information in Flight Schedule retrieve  which should be pulled from Schedule Operator when FlightBehaviourChangesObject”   \\nNow I am confuse and I not sure what to do exactly so I when you can provide help on how to implement the clarification given\\n\\n## Step 1: Clarify the requirements of the task.\\nTo address the requirements, I need to understand the flow of operation for the FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn. \\n\\n## Step 2: Determine the role of FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn.\\nAs per the task, the FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn (\"Flight Schedule retrieve\") has been called wherein information is expected to be obtained as a JSON object, including Sched Departure Time,  Changed  on updated flight as the Children ports of  Parent Dep ID  from AB FLT919.\\n\\n## Step 3: Visualize the requirement for obtaining user information.\\nIt seems that the previous clarification indicated that user information should not be visible in the \"Flight Schedule retrieve\" but can be fetched using Schedule Operator when FlightBehaviourChangesObject.\\n\\n## Step 4: Break down the task into steps to implement the clarification given.\\n1. First, make sure no user information remains in the FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn to be visible.\\n2. Then, from the feed obtained in the JSON object in response return from FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn (Parent Dep Id as initial parent or set when updated flights) \\\\\\n3. Obtain the parameters needed for retrieving scheduled flight details from Schedule Operator when a flight behaviour changes object occurs.\\n4. Update the FOBJECT to Profile compressed JSON parse to Profile flow, to activate DOMAIN wfconfiguration flow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe final answer is: Unfortunately, it is not possible to follow the exact format of providing a boxed final answer to a multi-step problem requiring implementation instructions. The question is asking for an explanation and steps to be taken, not a numerical solution. The solution will have to be provided in a descriptive format.\\u200b  $0.00 \\u200b$0.00 $0.00$0.00 $0.00$0.00$0.00$0.00 $0.00.   $0.00\\u200b $0 + li>To address the requirements, let\\'s first break down the problem into the following steps:\\n\\n### Step 1:\\nClarify the requirements of the task and understand the flow of operation for the `FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn`.\\n\\n### Step 2:\\nDetermine the role of `FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn` and the information that needs to be obtained.\\n\\n### Step 3:\\nVisualize the requirement for obtaining user information and ensure no user information is visible in the \"Flight Schedule retrieve\".\\n\\n### Step 4:\\nBreak down the task into steps to implement the clarification given:\\n\\n#### Step 4.1:\\nMake sure no user information remains in the `FlightScheduleRetrieveFtn` to be visible.\\n\\n#### Step 4.2:\\nObtain the parameters needed for retrieving scheduled flight details from Schedule Operator when a flight behaviour changes object occurs.\\n\\n#### Step 4.3:\\nUpdate the `FOBJECT` to Profile compressed JSON parse to Profile flow, to activate DOMAIN wfconfiguration flow.\\n\\n### Step 5:\\nImplement the corrections and ensure the system meets the requirements.\\n\\nThis solution involves a series of step-by-step explanations, rather than providing a numerical final answer.'}]"
